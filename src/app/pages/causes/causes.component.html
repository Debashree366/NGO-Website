									<p><b>WeCare Foundation</b> is dedicated to improving the lives and futures of India’s most
										 vulnerable children. We do this by partnering with communities at the grassroots, 
										 supporters in India and across the world, civil society, corporates and the local and 
										 national governments to create an environment where all children are educated, healthy,
										  protected and valued.</p>


									<p>Our work is facilitated through <b>Area Development Programmes (ADPs)</b>. This model of
										 development involved long-term engagement in a geographical area (usually contiguous) to 
										 lives of children and communities. When an ADP is begun, we assess the needs of the 
										 community and create a collaborative plan based on the community’s vision for its 
										 children.</p>


                                    <p>Together, we look at what’s already being done, what more can be done, and what we can do
										 together. We work through programmes focused on ensuring access to nutrition, healthcare,
										  water and sanitation, quality education and livelihood for the sustained well-being of 
										  children. Ensuring a secure childhood is paramount to our work, which we strive to
										  fulfil by building communities that are safe and fit for children.</p>


									<p><b>WeCare Foundation India</b> brings life-saving support in times of disaster. We are
										 committed to long-term rehabilitation, helping communities affected by natural disasters
										  or conflicts get back on their feet. We also work to make vulnerable communities more
										   resilient so they can respond immediately if disasters occur.</p>
